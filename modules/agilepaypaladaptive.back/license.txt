1. This is an agreement between Licensor and Licensee, who is being licensed to use the any software, modules, themes, modifications (herein as "Software").

2. Licensee acknowledges that this is only a limited nonexclusive license. Licensor is and remains the owner of all titles, rights, and interests in the Software.

3. This License permits Licensee to install the Software on more than one computer system, as long as the Software will not be used on more than one computer system simultaneously. Licensee will not make copies of the Software or allow copies of the Software to be made by others, unless authorized by this License Agreement. Licensee may make copies of the Software for backup purposes only.

4. All Software are provided "as is", without a warranty of any kind, either oral or written, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties or conditions of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, or the warranty of non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software.

5. We provide 30 days free technical support with our Software that are purchased from our site, but advice is always free. After 30 days, if you still face any issue, we will try to sort it out for a small fee discussed personally with each customer depending on complexity.


If the Software that are related to the same version of PrestaShop have been enhanced since the day you purchased, you'll get an update for free within 1 (one) year from the date of purchase, as long as the prices for the Software stay the same. If the prices for the modules or mods that are related to the same version of PrestaShop have been changed, you will need to pay for the difference. After 1 (one) year from the date of purchase, you will need to pay a small amount of upgrade fee plus the price difference if you choose to upgrade.


6. In case of a breach of the Limited Warranty, Licensee's exclusive remedy is as follows: Licensee will return all copies of the Software to Licensor, at Licensee's cost, along with proof of purchase. (Licensee can obtain a step-by-step explanation of this procedure, including a return authorization code, by contacting Licensor at [address and toll free telephone number].) At Licensor's option, Licensor will either send Licensee a replacement copy of the Software, at Licensor's expense, or issue a full refund.

7. Licensee agrees to defend and indemnify Licensor and hold Licensor harmless from all claims, losses, damages, complaints, or expenses connected with or resulting from Licensee's business operations.

8. Licensor has the right to terminate this License Agreement and Licensee's right to use this Software upon any material breach by Licensee.

9. Licensee agrees to return to Licensor or to destroy all copies of the Software upon termination of the License.

10. This License Agreement is the entire and exclusive agreement between Licensor and Licensee regarding this Software. This License Agreement replaces and supersedes all prior negotiations, dealings, and agreements between Licensor and Licensee regarding this Software.
